## Task-by-Task Analysis

## 1. Peer Comparison Widget

### **Business Objective**

Show how selected facility compares to peer group using cost per FTE, nursing department spend, and agency spend metrics with defensible peer matching criteria.

### **Query Strategy & Thought Process**

The queries implement a sophisticated peer matching algorithm:

1. **Target Identification**: Extract facility's key characteristics (CBSA, bed size, ownership type, Medicaid payer mix)
2. **Peer Discovery**: Find all facilities matching these exact criteria
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate averages, percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th, 80th) for benchmarking
4. **Trend Analysis**: Provide 12-month sparklines for facility vs peer performance

### **Tables Used & Relevance Analysis**

| Table                    | Rows   | Status       | Role & Importance                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dim_hospital`           | 6,918  | ‚úÖ Available | **Core Foundation** - Hospital identifiers, bed counts, ownership types, geographic references    |
| `fact_hcris_facility`    | 72,802 | ‚úÖ Available | **Essential Metrics** - Total costs, salaries, FTE counts, Medicare percentages for peer matching |
| `dim_zip_cbsa`           | 40,773 | ‚úÖ Available | **Geographic Matching** - CBSA codes and titles for location-based peer grouping                  |
| `dim_ownership_category` | 4      | ‚úÖ Available | **Ownership Classification** - Government, Non-profit, For-profit categorization                  |
| `fact_hcris_cost_center` | 0      | ‚ùå Missing   | **Critical Gap** - Department-level spending, especially nursing department spend                 |

### **Implementation Status**

- **‚úÖ Partially Functional**: Facility-level peer comparisons work
- **‚ùå Missing Feature**: Department-specific comparisons (nursing spend, agency spend)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Limited Metrics**: Only 3 of 5 intended metrics available

### **Workarounds & Solutions**

#### Immediate Solutions:

1. **Use Facility-Level Proxies**:

   ```sql
   -- Use total_salaries as proxy for nursing spend
   SELECT hf.total_salaries as nursing_spend_proxy
   FROM fact_hcris_facility hf
   ```

2. **CMS Job Category Mapping**:
   ```sql
   -- Estimate nursing spend using CMS job category data
   SELECT SUM(wages_paid) as estimated_nursing_spend
   FROM fact_cms_oms_job_category
   WHERE job_category_code IN (SELECT job_category_code
                              FROM dim_cms_oms_jobcategory_soc
                              WHERE job_category_label LIKE '%Nurs%')
   ```

#### Long-term Solutions:

- **Populate HCRIS Cost Center Data**: Import department-level cost data from CMS HCRIS reports

### **Query Strategy & Thought Process**

Multi-layered approach for departmental analysis:

1. **Department Ranking**: Order departments by absolute spend
2. **Peer Benchmarking**: Calculate median spend by department across peer hospitals
3. **Statistical Distribution**: Provide percentile analysis for each department
4. **Historical Trends**: 12-month sparklines showing departmental spend evolution

### **Tables Used & Relevance Analysis**

| Table                    | Rows   | Status                  | Role & Importance                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fact_hcris_cost_center` | 0      | ‚ùå **CRITICAL MISSING** | **Absolutely Essential** - Contains department-level wage and hour data |
| `dim_cost_center`        | 156    | ‚úÖ Available            | **Department Definitions** - Cost center names and classifications      |
| `dim_hospital`           | 6,918  | ‚úÖ Available            | **Hospital Context** - Facility identification for peer matching        |
| `dim_zip_cbsa`           | 40,773 | ‚úÖ Available            | **Peer Grouping** - Geographic matching for peer identification         |

### **Implementation Status**

- **‚ùå Complete Failure**: Primary data source is empty
- **üîÑ Alternative Available**: CMS job category data can substitute

### **Workarounds & Solutions**

#### Primary Alternative - CMS Job Category Analysis:

```sql
-- Replace department analysis with job category analysis
SELECT
    dcjs.job_category_label as department_name,
    SUM(fcoj.wages_paid) as total_spend,
    SUM(fcoj.hours_paid) as total_hours,
    AVG(fcoj.wages_paid) as avg_spend
FROM fact_cms_oms_job_category fcoj
JOIN dim_cms_oms_jobcategory_soc dcjs ON fcoj.job_category_code = dcjs.job_category_code
WHERE fcoj.hospital_ccn = :target_hospital
GROUP BY dcjs.job_category_label
ORDER BY total_spend DESC;
```

#### Mapping Strategy:

- **Available Job Categories**: 7 categories in `dim_cms_oms_jobcategory_soc`
- **Granularity Trade-off**: Less detailed than true cost centers but more actionable than facility-level data
- **Peer Comparison**: Still possible using same job categories across peer facilities
